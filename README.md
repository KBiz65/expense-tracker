## Summary

Creating an expense tracker is pretty simliar to creating a to-do list but adds some much needed functionality, like working with different kinds of input (text, dropdown, dates) as well as working with HTML tables.

This app allowed me to become much more comfortable with local storage as well as creating functions to add, remove, and display information from storage. It also helped me get a bit more comfortable working with tables as a whole.

It took approximately a week to build this as I took some time to have a thorough understanding of working with tables and an array of arrays. After working on this app I would easily say that my comfort level with Javascript is improving immensely.
